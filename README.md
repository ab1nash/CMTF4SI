## CMTF4SI: Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization for Satellite Images using Human-in-the-Loop

CMTF4SI is a tensor completion algorithm based on the concept of Coupled Matrix Tensor Factorization and Human-in-the-Loop. A manual mask is provided on top of a given image and subsequently processed and used as the coupled matrix in the objective function for CMTF4SI.
